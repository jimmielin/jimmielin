<sub>*Fun fact: I do not write Python unless compelled to by homework assignment. [Here is a work-in-progress atmospheric chemistry modeling workflow package written in Matlab/Octave](https://github.com/jimmielin/mtools). In a numerical class, [I wrote the problem sets in Haskell instead](https://github.com/jimmielin/HW-Numerical-Analysis-Spring-2016).* [I will even write CLI tools in PHP if I have to](https://github.com/jimmielin/wrf-gchp-dev-tools/tree/master/generate_gigc_convert_state_chm_spec).</sub>
